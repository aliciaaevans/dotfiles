# Some notes on `ls` on Mac...
#
# Vanilla MacOS, based on BSD, has a different `ls`. It uses -G instead
# of --color. The colors are also handled differently (dircolors is not
# available by default; uses different env vars for controlling colors).
#
# Previously depended on a conda environment with GNU coreutils
# installed so that we get the exact same colors as on Linux. That proved
# finicky. See [0] for some details.  so this always uses the system `ls` on Mac, setting the colors to be
# close enough.
#
# The solution here is:
#  - check $LS_COLORS (note underscore) in an environment with dircolors and GNU ls
#  - paste the value of $LS_COLORS into [2]
#  - copy the reported $LSCOLORS (no underscore) value. That will be used by BSD ls.
#  - export LSCOLORS on Mac.
